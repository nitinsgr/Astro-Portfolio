However, as a UX designer, I believe that any experience can be improved with the right approach and design.\r\n\r\n*By identifying pain points and areas for improvement, I hope to demonstrate the value of user-centered design in creating a more enjoyable and memorable dining experience. Please note that this case study is solely intended for educational purposes and not related to any specific project or client.*\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement in hand\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"p-4 my-2 bg-gray-50\">\r\n    <p class=\"text-[20px] font-opensans italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">The current restaurant reservation app for diners lacks usability and efficiency, resulting in a frustrating and inconvenient booking experience. Users encounter challenges in finding available reservations, navigating through a complex booking process, and receiving personalized recommendations. Communication with restaurants is inefficient, and the review system is inadequate for making informed dining choices.*</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI successfully completed this project in just 4 weeks by diligently following the design process. From the initial phase of empathizing with the users to conducting usability testing, I ensured thorough exploration to arrive at a well-founded conclusion for the project.\r\n\r\nView solution screens {Link}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### My Role\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-0\">\r\nI was a solo UX/UI Designer on this project, where I had the opportunity to take charge of all the tasks and workshops involved. As the sole designer, I was responsible for every aspect of the user experience and interface design, from conceptualization to final implementation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Design Process\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/Plan.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n### Understanding the Challenge\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the restaurant industry, Leading to a new set of challenges that establishements must navigate in the post-covid-19 era. As restuarants adapt to evloving landscape, they face unique problems both during and after pandemic.\r\n\r\n### During the Covid Pandemic\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"max-w-lg space-y-2 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400\">\r\n    <li>\r\n       Health and safety measures : Restaurants enforced health protocols, including sanitization, social distancing, and limited seating, impacting revenue and operations.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n       Financial Strain : Restaurants faced financial challenges due to reduced customers and restrictions on dine-in services. Adaptation and financial support were crucial for survival.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n### In the New Normal\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"max-w-lg space-y-2 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400\">\r\n    <li>\r\n      Changing the customer behavior : Consumer preferences shifted to health, hygiene, and contactless experiences. Restaurants must adapt with touchless services, safety transparency, and flexible dining\r\n    <li>\r\n    Post-lockdown, the desire to socialize and dine out has surged, leading to increased demand for restaurant services. Relaxation of restrictions has resulted in crowded establishments.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n## Formulating Assumptions and Testable Hypothesis\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\">Assumptions are made based on understanding the problem, existing data, and research. They are prioritized and tested to validate their impact and uncertainties. Thorough research enables informed decision-making by either proving or disproving assumptions, leading to evidence-based solutions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/assumption.svg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\">\r\nTo validate my assumptions, I categorized and identified the most challenging and risky ones. I transformed these assumptions into testable hypothesis statements to ensure they are validated through experiments and tools. The goal is to prove their validity and carry them forward in the next stages of the process.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"/h.svg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n## Empathize\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt this stage, a collection of insights about the users were made. Understanding the behaviour and mindset of the user helped me solve the problem for them. It enabled the delivery of a seamless exeprience by having an extensive understanding of how user interact with the relevant products.\r\n\r\n### Target User Group\r\n\r\n### User Survey\r\n\r\nA survey form was shared with 25 people out of which 22 people responded. I asked questions related to basic dining habbits and their point of view on online booking system.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"p-2 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800\">\r\n    <p class=\"text-[16px] font-opensans italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">By survey results I had few of my assumptions cleared and validated to be true in every other aspect.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n### User Interviews\r\n\r\nA survey form was shared with 25 people out of which 22 people responded. I asked questions related to basic dining habbits and their point of view on online booking system.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/doc.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-xl text-gray-900 dark:text-white font-opensans font-bold\">Key Insight</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"grid m-2 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-2\">\r\n <blockquote class=\"p-4 border-l-4 border-purple-300 bg-purple-50\">\r\n    <p class=\"text-[16px] font-opensans italic text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">User finds it important to have a real-time information, including accurate wait-time if there are no immediate reservation available</p>\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <blockquote class=\"p-4 h-3/4 max-w-1/4 border-l-4 border-orange-300 bg-orange-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800\">\r\n    <p class=\"text-[16px] font-opensans italic text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">Many participants were frustrated about real-time confirmation and notification. </p>\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote class=\"p-4 h-3/4 max-w-1/4 border-l-4 border-yellow-300 bg-yellow-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800\">\r\n    <p class=\"text-[16px] font-opensans italic text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">User would appreciate a streamlined and straightforward booking process that doesn’t involve excessive steps or complicated forms.

I put down each insight on one sticky note, found patterns, and grouped them together. As a result, I got 3 main user groups\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/y.svg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n### Empathy Mapping\r\n\r\nAn empathy map is valuable tool in understanding and empathizing with users or customers. It helps us gain insight into their thoughts, feelings motiviations, and pain-points. Allowing us to design a product that better meets their needs. I drafted an empathy map based on one of my user from the interview session.\r\n\r\n### Refining overall insights\r\n\r\nBased on the valuable information collected from the interview sessions, problem mapping(Affinity Map), and empathy map, we have gained deeper insights into the needs and pain points of our users. This data has allowed us to refine our understanding of their experiences and identify areas where improvements can be made.\r\n\r\nBy this point, I had my problem statement refined\r\n\r\nThe current reservation system in the restaurant lacks essential features and functionality, leading to a subpar user experience for diners. These issues encompass limited search capabilities, challenges with overcrowding and availability, a complex and lengthy reservation process, and a lack of real-time updates. The absence of a standardized user experience across different channels further compounds the problem, causing confusion and frustration among users.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"text-xl italic font-semibold text-gray-900 bg-gray-50 dark:text-white\">\r\n    <svg class=\"w-8 h-8 text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 14\">\r\n        <path d=\"M6 0H2a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4v1a3 3 0 0 1-3 3H2a1 1 0 0 0 0 2h1a5.006 5.006 0 0 0 5-5V2a2 2 0 0 0-2-2Zm10 0h-4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4v1a3 3 0 0 1-3 3h-1a1 1 0 0 0 0 2h1a5.006 5.006 0 0 0 5-5V2a2 2 0 0 0-2-2Z\"/>\r\n    </svg>\r\n    <p>\r\nHow might we enhance the dining experience of customers by providing an efficient and convenient reservation system, accommodating various seating preferences, offering flexible booking options, and providing real-time updates to ensure a seamless and satisfying dining experience?\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n### How might we? (HMW)\r\n\r\nNow to create questions out of these problems, the how might we statement method is used. The outcome of HMW method is to give a point to ideate solutions.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:gap-6 md:grid-cols-2\">\r\n<ul class=\"max-w-md space-y-4 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        How might we <u class=\"underline text-red-600\">simplify the online reservation process</u> to make it more user-friendly and intuitive for customers?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        How might we improve the <u class=\"underline text-red-600\">search and filtering options</u> to help customers and find restaurant that aligns their dietary and other specific preferences.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        How might we ensure accurate and <u class=\"underline text-red-600\">real-time availability information</u> to prevent customers from encountering booking conflicts and unavaibility time slots.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"max-w-md space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-400\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        How might we enhance the <u class=\"underline text-red-600\">mobile user experience</u> for the online reservation, ensuring responsiveness and optimized performance across different devices.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n       How might we incorporate personalized recommendations and tailored suggestions based on customers' past dining preferences and feedback?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n       How might we provide proactive communication and notifications, keeping customers updated about their reservation status, any changes, or special offers?\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Ideate\r\n\r\nUsing the crazy’8 technique, solution to tackle the poor experience and usability were ideated. There were three type of solution - To enhance and improve the search capabilities for a diner, reduce overcrowding and table management issues, and simplfy the booking process for the diners.\r\n\r\n> Generated ideas based on the how might we statements\r\n\r\n### Brainstorming and Dot Voting Excerise\r\n\r\n### User Storyboarding\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/story.jpeg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"a title\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\" />\r\n";
